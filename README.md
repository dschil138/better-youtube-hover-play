# Stop YouTube Hover Previews


The YouTube homepage autoplays video previews anytime your mouse goes over a thumbnail. This can be very distracting while trying to browse.

This extension gives you three options for disabling that.

1. DISABLE ONLY FOR SCROLLING
Closest to default behavior. Video previews will play when you hover over a video, but only if you purposefully move your mouse to the video. If your mouse goes over a video while scrolling, or just lands on it after scrolling, it will not play.

2. PLAY ON LONG CLICK (Recommended)
Videos do not play on hover, but can be triggered by a "long click". Click and hold down on a video for a moment and the video preview will begin playing. It will keep playing until you move your mouse off the video.

3. COMPLETE DISABLE
Disable the video previews altogether. Do not play video previews ever.

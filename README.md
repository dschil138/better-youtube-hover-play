# Disable YouTube Hover Autoplay

The YouTube homepage autoplays video previews anytime your mouse goes over a thumbnail, even when you're scrolling.

This Chrome extension turns off those autoplays while scrolling, so video previews will only play if you purposefully move your mouse to hover over that video.

The extension settings also give you the option to completely disable the autoplays altogether.

There aro two options for this extension

The first allows you to turn off the hover autoplay entirely, or only turn off the autoplay only while scrolling. This way if you purposefully move your mouse to hover over a video thumbnail, it will still autoplay. But if your mouse is only over the thumbnail becaus you are scrolling, it will not. 

The second allows you to turn on a "autoplay on long click" functionality. If you click and hold down for longer that 250ms, the video will begin autoplaying. You do not need to keep your click held down past that. The video will stop autoplaying when you move your mouse elsewhere.

# Disable YouTube Hover Autoplay

The YouTube homepage autoplays video previews anytime your mouse goes over a thumbnail, even when you're scrolling.

This Chrome extension turns off those autoplays while scrolling, so video previews will only play if you purposefully move your mouse to hover over that video.

The extension settings also give you the option to completely disable the autoplays altogether.
